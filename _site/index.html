<h1 id="racket-ladder-v01">Racket Ladder v0.1</h1>

<p>Automated ladder for racket sports (intended for clubs who want to keep an “internal ladder” for their members)</p>

<h2 id="warning--this-is-a-quick--dirty-phpmysql-prototype">WARNING : this is a quick &amp; dirty PHP/MySQL prototype</h2>

<ul>
  <li>No authentication</li>
  <li>No security concerns checked</li>
  <li>No pagination</li>
  <li>No backend/frontend framework used</li>
  <li>Uses PHP globals</li>
  <li>All static text is in french language (+ suited for my local badminton club)</li>
</ul>

<p>OBVIOUSLY NOT SUITED FOR ONLINE PRODUCTION PURPOSES.</p>

<p>However, it can be safely used on a computer / virtual machine if only accessible &amp; used locally.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>List/add <strong>players</strong> (first name, last name)</li>
  <li>List/add <strong>played sets</strong> (winner, loser, x2 if doubles)</li>
  <li>Show <strong>ladders</strong> for the 5 supported <strong>game types</strong> (men singles, women singles, men doubles, women doubles, mixed doubles)</li>
  <li>At each <strong>set</strong> addition, new <strong>players “values” (scores)</strong>, thus their ranking in the game type’s ladder, are computed automatically.
Scores changes depends on :
    <ul>
      <li>Players “original” scores (right before the set was played), starting at 0</li>
      <li>Wins/losses (obviously)</li>
      <li>Number of sets already played before</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notes for players</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Your score will be “auto adjusted” according to your performance (particularly quickly when you are a newcomer).</li>
  <li>In order to get a good score (thus a better ranking) in the ladder, beat players with highest scores possible.</li>
  <li>You are advised to meet players in a range of +/-10pts around your score.</li>
  <li>A 100pts player winning a 10pts player will change nothing to scores/ladder.</li>
  <li>A 100pts player losing to a 10pts one, will show <em>significant</em> changes (depending on the number of sets already played).</li>
</ul>
